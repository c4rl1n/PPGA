                <ul>
                    <li> We seek to destigmatize sex and sexual health, promote safe sex practices and general reproductive health information, and provide resources for all the above </li>
                    <li> Tabling is for dispensing external/male condoms, dental dams, female condoms, and informational pamphlets on topics such as, but not limited, to birth control, STIs, HPV vaccine, how to donate to abortion funds. </li>
                    <li> Raise awareness about social, political, and/or health issues and how to help Cornell, Ithaca, NY state, nationwide. </li>
                    <li> Tabling is a branding opportunity for both PPGA at Cornell and Planned Parenthood as a larger organization which advocates socio-politically for reproductive rights for all. </li>
