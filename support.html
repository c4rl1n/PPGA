                <p class = "fundraiser_txt_body">  On September 8th, 2021, Texas Senate Bill 8 (SB8) was signed into law, marking the strictest ban enacted on abortion since pre-Roe v. Wade. SB8 prohibits Texans from seeking an abortion after 6 weeks of pregnancy, a time when most people do not know they are pregnant yet. While Texans with the finances may be able to travel out of state to obtain abortion care, this ban presents a significant challenge to those with a limited income, disproportionately affecting communities of color. Abortion funds help alleviate the financial burden imposed on individuals in need by covering the costs of the abortion procedure and the costs associated with travel and lodging to states where abortion is still accessible. The funds we raise will be shared among 10 different abortion funds in the state of Texas (Texas Equal Access Fund, Fund Texas Choice, West Fund, Clinic Access Support Network, the Lilith Fund, The Bridge Collective, Jane's Due Process, Whole Woman's Health Alliance, Inc., Frontera Fund, and Support Your Sistah at the Afiya Center). </p>
